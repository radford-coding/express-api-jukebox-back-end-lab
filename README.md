# Jukebox Back-End Lab

Reactvilleâ€™s community center is launching a public jukebox, and they need your expertise to build the backend API that powers it! This jukebox will allow residents to freely add, update, and delete music tracks from a shared community playlist.

In this module, students will practice the fundamentals of building and managing an Express API. They will implement full CRUD operations, allowing users to freely interact with a music database. The main focus of this module is on setting up robust routes to handle different types of resource requests, using async/await for asynchronous processes, and managing errors effectively with try/catch blocks.

By the end of this module, students will have constructed a fully functional REST API for a community-driven jukebox, ready to be connected to a front-end application.
